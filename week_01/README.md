# Week 01 — Titanic EDA

## Goal
Set up a reproducible Python environment, learn the basics of NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, and apply them to exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset.

## Daily Plan
- [x] **Day 0 — Preparation**: project structure, environment setup, library installation
- [x] **Day 1 — Environment check**: run Jupyter, import libraries, create a simple test plot
- [x] **Day 2 — NumPy basics**: arrays, slicing, broadcasting, basic statistics
- [x] **Day 3 — pandas basics**: load Titanic dataset, inspect data, identify missing values
- [x] **Day 4 — Visualization**: age distribution, survival by class, bar/histogram plots
- [x] **Day 5 — EDA Part 1**: explore categorical features (Sex, Pclass, Embarked)
- [x] **Day 6 — EDA Part 2**: combined features, family size, advanced visualizations
- [x] **Day 7 — Wrap-up**: summarize insights, finalize notebook, commit results

## Deliverables
- Executed Jupyter notebook with Titanic EDA
- Plots saved in `week_01/plots/`
- Updated `requirements.txt`
- This README with summary and references

## Key Insights
- Women and children had higher survival rates
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive
- Embarkation port showed differences in survival rates
- Family size influenced outcomes: single travelers had lower survival
